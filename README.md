## Lotto 

**This project is a lottery built with the foundry framework, users can buy a ticket, and get a chance to win the prize pool. The fees go to the prize pool. after a period of time, it will choose a random winner. I will use chainlink VRF --> randomness and chainlink Automation --> time-based trigger.**
